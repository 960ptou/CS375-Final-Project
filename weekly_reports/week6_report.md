- Weijie Chen
  - There will some issues working with cookies (never used them)
    - the plan is to do search on google.

- Adesewa Adesida
  - Not sure whether I should do the mock product using wordpress or I should create a slideshow since there will
	be a presentation later anyway
	- the plan is to follow the path of least resistance.






#### 4.Reflection

- So far, we have been able to work well as a team to come up with a proposal and plan for what we are executing for our final project. Our intended meeting dates will be Wednesday and Fridays mostly to do our tasks on wednesday and Friday to do our weekly update. We plan to start mostly on the functionality first and then develop the style later on.

- The project seems fine, the DB has some sort of tables that should be modified later as things gets implemented.

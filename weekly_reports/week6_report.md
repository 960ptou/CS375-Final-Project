Reflection
  So far, we have been able to work well as a team to come up with a proposal and plan for what we are executing for our final project. Our intended meeting dates will be Wednesday 
  and Fridays mostly to do our tasks on wednesday and Friday to do our weekly update. We plan to start mostly on the functionality first and then develop the style later on.

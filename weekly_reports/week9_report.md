  - Things Completed last week
    - Fill up the database with some data for testing and image for cover (private books ...) -> (5hrs)
      - nothing much to say here... I was trying to be creative with some AI image, took longer than expect and found nothing... (I don't want faces as my book cover)
    - Main page interaction for search (1hr)
      - Not planned, but I did the search so I just do that to display..
    - search on genre, name, ~blur search? (2hrs)
      - Needs a extension for postgres, the coding part wasn't hard.
  
  - Things to be done next week (want to save a week for testing):
    - the private I/O
      - reading private book (prevent other people from reading) ~ 2hrs
      - removing private books (if they have a public book they can't remove it-> I hate that) ~ 2hrs
    - user option - background | font | color (with localstorage to long term) ~2hrs
    - cleaning up (since I want to finish it) ~ 3-4hrs
  

#### 3. Logisitical or technical obstacles
- Weijie Chen
  - was actually quick simple after finding the extension for fuzzy search

#### 4.Reflection
- So the reading part of the code is done (90% need some styling for UI), there's the upload book, private delete, reading private books.. 


#### 5. question for professors
- (weijie) -> I have 2 route, "cred" and "search", for private search I need a dictionary (for cookie session) from the credientialRoute.js in the searchRoute.js. (-> I don't want to store session in database..)

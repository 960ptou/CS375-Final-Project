# CS375-Final-Project


#### [Template](https://www.figma.com/file/nJrHOSYPBl8C7SFzxBh3N7/groupB?node-id=0%3A1)


#### Some notes:
```
Why do app.use(express.static( __dirname + "/../public/login")); for every file? Why not app.use(express.static( __dirname + ".../public")); ?

A: 2 parts
- I want to keep thing separated they won't need all to be within the public folder.
- from the first part, I also want the route to be simple, so no login/login.html...
```

### Run instruction
```bash
# create a env.json that looks like
Replace the username and password (make sure account has proper crediential); keep the other ones.
'
{
    "user": "username",
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "test",
    "password": "your password to db",
    "port": 5432
}
'
pip install -r dummy_setup/requirements.txt # please note, pip19.x might not work. -> update your pip
npm install

# in the project directory

# to add some book -> there are 2 options at this point (connection between user & book are not current set)

# so just adding the books to the 'books' folder will do it.
# option 1 script (generate random txt via Faker)
# then to generate some random content books
python dummy_setup/makeDummybooks.py N # N is the number of random books to generate

# run the follow to get cvs will generated data 
python dummy_setup/fillDatabaseFromBooks.py N # N > 0 is the number of random users to generate in the csv; not all users will hold a book, but all book with by held by a user 
bash dummy_setup/filldb.bash # puts the csv generated by script to the database

# OR just -> same stuff but easier
bash dummy_setup/refreshNload.bash N


# option 2 
# I've crawl some books from "https://www.gutenberg.org/"
# you can download them from "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UakaEMHfPZQwZl4uvVvrLi2BUqNq-1FC/view?usp=sharing"
# NOTE -> you the directory won't have the actual book name, you want to do it in the one by one method to allow that
# unzip the file and upload the each folder after you login. or 

# run this, after you put the folder books in the folder into the "./books" folder in the repo (create it first)
bash dummy_setup/refreshNload.bash N

# start server
npm run start

# At this point you can really just go to
"http://localhost:3000/", it will have some random books with images to links

# at this point it's more about the actual UI.
# For Readers, just click on any book on the main page, you can do search by genre, author, book id, book name
# Note, they are automatic, so if you type something like "fantasy", it will know you mean the genre
# book name in specific allows some degree of blur search, I.E. "bookname" can be found by "boname"

# For people who wants to upload here's few notes:
# You can upload book for PUBLIC and PRIVATE,
# You can ONLY DELETE PRIVATE book that YOU uploaded.
# if a book is decided to be private, then only YOU can read it.


# Instruction to UPLOAD:
# after login, you will be bring to your profile page, on the left there's a "add book" button,
# you will be redirected to a page for uploading your book
# please fill the required fields( author, book name,language , genres(up to 5, min 1),and whether you want it private or not).
# To upload a book, you need your folder structured and just drag that folder to the box.
# the structure should look like
- DIRECTORY
    - cover.png/jpg
    - Volume1 (please index this correctly)
        - arc1.txt
        - arc2.txt
    - volume2... 
# please note that the volume name will be used as the title for that volume, same for the arcs
```

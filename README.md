# CS375-Final-Project


#### [Template](https://www.figma.com/file/nJrHOSYPBl8C7SFzxBh3N7/groupB?node-id=0%3A1)


#### Some notes:
```
Why do app.use(express.static( __dirname + "/../public/login")); for every file? Why not app.use(express.static( __dirname + ".../public")); ?

A: 2 parts
- I want to keep thing separated they won't need all to be within the public folder.
- from the first part, I also want the route to be simple, so no login/login.html...
```

### Run instruction
```bash
# create a env.json that looks like
Replace the username and password (make sure account has proper crediential); keep the other ones.
'
{
    "user": "username",
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "test",
    "password": "your password to db",
    "port": 5432
}
'
pip install -r dummy_setup/requirements.txt # please note, pip19.x might not work. -> update your pip
npm install

# in the project directory
bash ./dummy_setup/refreshdb.bash # refresh the db

# to add some book -> there are 2 options at this point (connection between user & book are not current set)

# so just adding the books to the 'books' folder will do it.
# option 1 script (generate random txt via Faker)
# then to generate some random content books
python dummy_setup/makeDummybooks.py N # N is the number of random books to generate


# option 2 
# first, make a directory called books in the same place as root
# download https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iyjwiT2JEcub1a-WFCVo-FsfX37N-Csu?usp=sharing (a fake book generated via faker) -> put that in the books folder

# run the follow to get cvs will generated data 
python dummy_setup/fillDatabaseFromBooks.py N # N > 0 is the number of random users to generate in the csv; not all users will hold a book, but all book with by held by a user 
bash dummy_setup/filldb.bash # puts the csv generated by script to the database

# start server
npm run start

# At this point you can really just go to
"http://localhost:3000/", it will have some random books with images to links


# to see that book, please go to 
`http://localhost:3000/book/BOOKID/volumes`
# BOOKID is the long number in the books folder
- books
    - 12345678 # go to http://localhost:3000/book/12345678/volumes to see it.
    - ...
# The looks in there are the arc contents.

# for testing adding a user
bash ./dummy_setup/testUser.bash # adds a user "test" with pass "test"
# Then you will need to login into the site to login
"http://localhost:3000/login.html"
# OR if you want the full experience of UI
go to "http://localhost:3000/"
and there is a login + signup..

# You can't find a cookie, but in the broswer console do, you will see that if you are logged in.
'fetch("/cred/loggedin").then((response) => {console.log(response)})'
```

2) Project Description
	A novel viewing site. We will have ports for users to add a whole directory of novels (in a specific format), to upload everything to the side to display, the user should be able to update and delete their portion of the novel from the DB. For displaying we allow dynamic formatting for the user (fonts, size, spacing, and other things we consider as issues )

3) CRUD

4) fuzzy search, auto complete (getting ABC will give ABCDEÉ) and different language versions of same book

i) Weijie Ð Server side development, Database, ~ somewhat comfortable, since I did web scrapers, there are some experiences  working with DOMs, and some UI for coop that requires html, css. For splitting work, weÕll try our best to balance things by helping.

Sewa- IÕve had prior experience with a web dev team for mostly backend and some front end. I would say IÕm comfortable I will do what I have to do . I will stay on top of my tasks so if I need help, I can ask on time.
